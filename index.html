        <p>Marcus Garvey (1887-1940) was a Jamaican political leader, publisher, journalist, and orator who was a staunch proponent of Black nationalism and Pan-Africanism. He founded the Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA) in 1914, which aimed to unify and empower people of African descent worldwide. Garvey is best known for his efforts to promote African cultural pride and economic independence, as well as his advocacy for the return of the African diaspora to their ancestral lands. His legacy includes his influence on future civil rights movements and leaders, despite facing significant opposition and legal challenges during his lifetime. Garvey's vision and rhetoric laid important groundwork for later movements advocating for racial equality and self-determination.</p>
